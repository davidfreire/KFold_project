Extra utils that are not included in the main Keras repository.

Includes:
- An image generator class flowing images not from a directory but from a list of images.
- A K-Folds cross-validation class that loads images from a directory. The directory of the dataset is arranged in a structured way where your subdirectories keep classes of the images.

Tested on Keras.
